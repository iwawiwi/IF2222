# Arguments in Python

## `*args`

The special syntax `*args` in function definitions in python is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. It is used to pass a non-key worded, variable-length argument list. 

- The syntax is to use the symbol `*` to take in a variable number of arguments; by convention, it is often used with the word `args`.
- What `*args` allows you to do is take in more arguments than the number of formal arguments that you previously defined. With `*args`, any number of extra arguments can be tacked on to your current formal parameters (including zero extra arguments).
- For example : we want to make a multiply function that takes any number of arguments and able to multiply them all together. It can be done using `*args`.
- Using the `*`, the variable that we associate with the `*` becomes an **iterable** meaning you can do things like iterate over it, run some higher-order functions such as map and filter, etc.

Example #1

```Python
# Python program to illustrate 
# *args for variable number of arguments
def myFun(*argv):
    for arg in argv:
        print (arg)
   
myFun('Hello', 'Welcome', 'to', 'GeeksforGeeks')
```

Example #2

```Python
# Python program to illustrate 
# *args for variable number of arguments
def myFun(*argv):
    for arg in argv:
        print (arg)
   
myFun('Hello', 'Welcome', 'to', 'GeeksforGeeks')
```

## `**kwargs`

The special syntax `**kwargs` in function definitions in python is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list. We use the name `kwargs` with the double star. The reason is because the double star allows us to pass through keyword arguments (and any number of them).

- A keyword argument is where you provide a name to the variable as you pass it into the function.
- One can think of the `kwargs` as being a dictionary that maps each keyword to the value that we pass alongside it. That is why when we iterate over the `kwargs` there doesnâ€™t seem to be any order in which they were printed out.

```Python
# Python program to illustrate 
# *kwargs for variable number of keyword arguments
 
def myFun(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print ("%s == %s" %(key, value))
 
# Driver code
myFun(first ='Geeks', mid ='for', last='Geeks')   
```
